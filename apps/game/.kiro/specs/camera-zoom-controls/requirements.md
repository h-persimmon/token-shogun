# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements screen zoom functionality with pinch and pan controls for the camera control system. Players will be able to zoom in and out of the game map using pinch gestures on touch devices and mouse wheel on desktop devices. The implementation includes configurable maximum and minimum zoom levels to ensure optimal gameplay experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to zoom in and out of the game map using pinch gestures on touch devices, so that I can get a better view of specific areas or see more of the battlefield

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player performs a pinch-in gesture on a touch device THEN the camera SHALL zoom out proportionally to the pinch distance
2. WHEN the player performs a pinch-out gesture on a touch device THEN the camera SHALL zoom in proportionally to the pinch distance
3. WHEN the player continues pinching THEN the zoom level SHALL update smoothly in real-time
4. WHEN the pinch gesture ends THEN the zoom level SHALL remain at the final position

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to zoom in and out using mouse wheel on desktop devices, so that I can control the zoom level with precise input

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player scrolls the mouse wheel up THEN the camera SHALL zoom in by a fixed increment
2. WHEN the player scrolls the mouse wheel down THEN the camera SHALL zoom out by a fixed increment
3. WHEN the player scrolls rapidly THEN the zoom changes SHALL accumulate smoothly without jarring jumps
4. WHEN the mouse cursor is over the game area THEN mouse wheel events SHALL be captured for zoom control

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable minimum and maximum zoom levels, so that I can control the gameplay experience and prevent players from zooming too far in or out

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the zoom level reaches the maximum limit THEN further zoom-in attempts SHALL be ignored
2. WHEN the zoom level reaches the minimum limit THEN further zoom-out attempts SHALL be ignored
3. WHEN zoom limits are configured THEN the system SHALL validate and apply these limits
4. IF no zoom limits are specified THEN the system SHALL use default minimum (0.5x) and maximum (3.0x) values
5. WHEN zoom limits are changed during runtime THEN the current zoom level SHALL be clamped to the new limits if necessary

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the camera to maintain its focus point during zoom operations, so that the area I'm looking at remains centered

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN zooming in with pinch gesture THEN the zoom SHALL center around the midpoint between the two touch points
2. WHEN zooming with mouse wheel THEN the zoom SHALL center around the mouse cursor position
3. WHEN the zoom center point is near map boundaries THEN the system SHALL adjust to keep the camera within valid bounds
4. WHEN zooming while the camera is at a map boundary THEN the zoom SHALL still function while respecting boundary constraints

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the zoom system to integrate seamlessly with existing camera controls, so that panning and zooming work together without conflicts

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player is panning the camera THEN zoom gestures SHALL be disabled to prevent conflicts
2. WHEN the player is zooming THEN panning gestures SHALL be disabled during the zoom operation
3. WHEN zoom level changes THEN the existing camera boundary system SHALL adjust to the new zoom level
4. WHEN the game is paused THEN zoom controls SHALL be disabled along with other camera controls
5. IF other systems modify the camera zoom THEN the zoom control system SHALL reflect the updated zoom level

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth and responsive zoom animations, so that the zoom experience feels natural and polished

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN zoom level changes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and not jarring
2. WHEN rapid zoom inputs occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without performance issues
3. WHEN zoom operations complete THEN the final zoom level SHALL be stable and precise
4. WHEN the device has limited performance THEN zoom operations SHALL maintain acceptable frame rates
