# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements intelligent enemy target switching behavior to create more engaging and realistic combat interactions. When enemies receive melee attacks from allied units, they should respond by switching their target to engage the attacking unit rather than ignoring the threat and continuing to their original destination. This creates more dynamic combat scenarios where players can use tactical positioning to redirect enemy attention and protect key objectives.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want enemies to respond to attacks from my units by switching their target to the attacking unit, so that combat feels more realistic and tactical positioning becomes meaningful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an enemy unit receives a melee attack from an allied unit THEN the system SHALL change the enemy's target to the attacking allied unit
2. WHEN an enemy switches target due to an attack THEN the system SHALL update the enemy's movement destination to pursue the new target
3. WHEN an enemy has switched targets THEN the system SHALL prioritize the new target over the original target until combat conditions change
4. IF the new target moves out of reasonable pursuit range THEN the system SHALL allow the enemy to revert to its original target or select a new appropriate target

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the target switching behavior to be intelligent and not cause enemies to constantly flip between targets, so that combat remains strategic rather than chaotic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an enemy has recently switched targets THEN the system SHALL apply a cooldown period before allowing another target switch
2. WHEN multiple allied units attack the same enemy simultaneously THEN the system SHALL prioritize the target based on defined criteria (proximity, threat level, or attack timing)
3. WHEN an enemy is already engaged in combat with a target THEN the system SHALL require a higher threshold for switching to a new target
4. IF an enemy's current target is destroyed or becomes invalid THEN the system SHALL immediately allow target switching to any attacking unit

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the target switching system to integrate seamlessly with existing targeting and movement systems, so that it doesn't disrupt current game mechanics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN target switching occurs THEN the system SHALL work with the existing TargetingSystem without breaking current functionality
2. WHEN an enemy switches targets THEN the system SHALL properly update both TargetComponent and MovementComponent states
3. WHEN target switching is triggered THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing attack range and movement stopping behaviors
4. IF target switching conflicts with other systems THEN the system SHALL provide clear priority rules for resolution

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure target switching behavior parameters, so that I can balance gameplay and adjust the feature for different enemy types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load configurable parameters for target switching cooldown, priority rules, and pursuit range
2. IF no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible default values (2-second cooldown, proximity-based priority, 150% of attack range for pursuit)
3. WHEN different enemy types are present THEN the system SHALL support type-specific target switching behaviors
4. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL apply them without requiring a restart
