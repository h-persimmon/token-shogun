# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create core interfaces and types
  - Define MapBounds, CameraState, DragState, and CameraControlConfig interfaces
  - Create type definitions for camera control system
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 2. Implement MapBoundsCalculator utility class
  - Create utility class for calculating map boundaries from tilemap data
  - Implement static methods for different boundary calculation scenarios
  - Add viewport bounds calculation functionality
  - Write unit tests for boundary calculations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 3. Create CameraControlSystem class structure
  - Implement basic class structure with constructor and core properties
  - Set up initialization logic for camera, bounds, and state management
  - Create public interface methods (setMapBounds, getCameraPosition, etc.)
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 4. Implement input event handling
  - Create pointer down event handler for drag initiation
  - Implement pointer move event handler for camera movement during drag
  - Add pointer up event handler for drag termination
  - Set up input event listeners and cleanup
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 5. Implement camera position update logic
  - Create camera position update method with delta calculations
  - Implement boundary clamping logic to prevent camera from moving outside map bounds
  - Add smooth camera movement with configurable sensitivity
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 6. Add visual feedback system
  - Implement cursor state management (grab, grabbing, normal)
  - Create cursor update logic based on drag state
  - Add visual feedback for drag operations
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 7. Implement error handling and safety measures
  - Add try-catch blocks for critical operations
  - Create safe camera state reset functionality
  - Implement validation for map bounds and camera positions
  - Add error logging and recovery mechanisms
  - _Requirements: 5.3_
