# How Kiro was used
This document explains how Kiro was utilized in the development of this project.

## Use of GitHub MCP

### Key Implementation
* Integrated [GitHub MCP](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) to track Kiro instructions through GitHub issues
* Improved development progress visibility and team collaboration

### Impact on Workflow

#### Better Code Review
* Issue-driven development created natural review checkpoints during rapid Vibe Coding
* Human oversight improved significantly with structured task tracking

#### Flexible Integration
* Worked effectively for both "Spec" requests (detailed) and "Vibe" requests (intuitive)
* GitHub issue referencing adapted to different development styles

### Automation Success
* **Agent Hook** monitors `.kiro/specs/*/tasks.md` files
* Automatically creates Pull Requests when all tasks are completed
* Streamlined development-to-review pipeline

## Nice to have
* It would be nice to have a simpler way to handle secure configuration without including sensitive information in mcp.json
